A reference is a scalar that refers to a value
The target value may be scalar, an array, a hash, or a function
The reference itself is a scalar value
create a reference with a back slash (\)

references:
$rs = \$scalar;
$ra = \@array;
$rh = \%hash;
$rf = \&function;

To access the target value by dereferencing using tje correct type symbol and enclosing the scalar refernce in curly brackets {}

${$rs}
@{$ra}
%{$rh}
&{$rf}

we can also use arrow operator (->) to dereference and access structure members at the same time

$ra -> [$si]
$rh -> {key}
$rf -> ()

Anonymous Structures
References allows the use of anonymous arrays, hashes and functions.
This can be extremely handy for creating complex data structures.
$r = { a => [1,2,3],
       h => {k => 'y'},
       f => sub { say 'foo' }
     };

To know the type of function
ref($r) -> returns string indicating the type of refernced value
